so this is a
database thing
but do you think it'd be cool to keep track of stats like
total maps played
total maps won
total tourney wins
etc
so you get this comprehensive stats overview like on hltv.org
https://www.hltv.org/stats/players/4954/xyp9x


ideas I came up with in the shower:
--------------
all of the above stuff can go into a more comprehensive ELO system
possible ELO calculation methods:
- ELO gain/loss as a function of your per-pick performance vs avg opponent score + your elo relative to your opponents (losing when your opponents are higher elo makes you lose less elo than you normally would)
- ELO based on your performance vs. a per-beatmap calculated standard ELO (if every beatmap had their own rough ELO value, this might be a tool to help mappoolers balance more typical mappools)
- in the case of !mp aborts or warmups, prob need an interface for referees to manually disable a pick from being included in ELO calculation
- not sure how this would work with tournaments that don't use scorev2 win condition (maybe just invalidate elo for those tournies xd)
------------
tournaments can be either pp-rank-restricted or elo-restricted
elo-restricted tournaments theoretically being more "reputable"
prevent malicious elo farming by assigning "verified" badges to reputable tournament hosts (assigned on a case-by-case basis) where only verified hosts can create tournaments that are valid for elo calculations
--------------
everyone would probably start at an elo relative to their current pp rank, so it effectively serves as a clean fresh slate for tourney players who have 999999x badges
- maybe separate "solo elo" and "team elo"
- also elo separated by mode
-----------------
somehow save every match into db? I think some multi lobbies get erased after some time (can use this to view player tournament history)
and that would all imply elo leaderboards xd
------------
can possibly create new UIs to serve as an alternative to the standard mp link lobby (to show more interesting elo-related stats/hide warmups/etc)
thinking that for something like this
the following would get their own id in a db:
- each individual pick
- each match
(these might be foreign keys referenced in each user/player entry so that we can display a tournament history on their profiles)
---------------
optional: similar to how "osu.ppy.sh/b/xxxxxx resolves to an expanded link with the beatmapset id included, we could do something similar with "pick id", "match id", and "tourney id"

not entirely sure how to implement this without a global id counter thing (which I've learned is kinda clunky and not good xd)

------------
- unofficial badge system so that players can view badges sooner/more tournaments get badged/tournies can have 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place badges (unofficial badges can be displayed on players' profiles)
- "verified" hosts/poolers/refs/testplayers/custom mappers
----------------
a better system for monitoring custom maps instead of just slinging around .osz files in discord
-----------------
separate user profiles into staffing & playing section
---------------
Page for viewing all mappools from any tournaments
- filterable/sortable by elo/rank/avg sr/etc
----------------
- invitational tournament system
- per-tournament player blacklist
---------------
tournaments can select their own "accent color" to change the yellow on the site to anything else when viewing their pages
----------------
featured tournaments/livestreams on home page
--------------
should be able to calculate total match time from mp links
- just a cool stat to view on match pages
-------------------
betting system for matches
- you wouldn't actually win anything tho
-------------------
- adding a timezone column to the user table might also be necessary for scheduling + displaying match times
-------------------
- might need a win condition column for mappools (eg. scorev2 + best of 11, accuracy + best of 9)
- and also a "no. of bans" column associated with each mappools
-------------------
- if auto reffing becomes a thing, we might also need a special flag to identify the "tiebreaker" maps
-------------------
- qualifier pools might also need their own distinction
because there could be any number of teams/players in a single lobby
and maps either get played in mappool order or in some random sequence
